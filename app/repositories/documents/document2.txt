Title: Machine Learning Basics
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. ML algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
